<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="idyl_toc.html#SEC1">Overview</A></H1>

<P>
IDyl is an interpreter for a language resembling Dylan (trademark of
Apple Computer). It is a first step towards the implementation of a
production quality compiler for Dylan. It is currently being developped
by Dominique Boucher, Marc Feeley, Marco Jacques, Jacques
Malenfant, and Manuel Serrano.

</P>
<P>
Although IDyl provides a few extensions to Dylan, there are many
features that are missing.  IDyl is essentially a pedogagical tool,
primarily intended for the exploration of the Dylan language and its
implementation. It should be kept in mind that IDyl is still
experimental and is not meant for production use.

</P>
<P>
The latest version of IDyl can be obtained through the INTERNET
from the following anonymous FTP site:

</P>
<P>
	<CODE>ftp.iro.umontreal.ca:pub/parallele/idyl/idyl-0.1</CODE>

</P>
<P>
Comments, questions, and bug reports are welcome and should be
sent to:

</P>



<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="idyl_toc.html#SEC2">Compiling IDyl</A></H1>

<P>
The interpreter can be built using one of the following Scheme
compilers: 

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Bigloo 1.7 or later

<LI>Gambit-C 2.2 or later

</UL>

<P>
Here are the steps to follow in order to properly install IDyl:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Edit the Makefile to suit your needs. The following variables
should be changed: <CODE>A.OUT</CODE>, <CODE>SCMCONFIGDIR</CODE>,
<CODE>INSTALL_DIR</CODE>, <CODE>LIB_DIR</CODE>, <CODE>INSTALL</CODE>, <CODE>CC</CODE>,
<CODE>GAMBIT</CODE>, <CODE>BIGLOO</CODE>, and <CODE>MKAFILE</CODE>.
<LI>

Run <CODE>make config</CODE> to configure the interpreter.
<LI>

Run <CODE>make bigloo</CODE> or <CODE>make gambit</CODE> to build the
interpreter. 
<LI>

Run <CODE>make install</CODE> to install the libraries.
</OL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="idyl_toc.html#SEC3">The Read-Eval-Print loop.</A></H1>

<P>

</P>
<P>
IDyl is invoked using the following command:

</P>

<PRE>
idyl [-emacs] [f1 f2 f3 ...]
</PRE>

<P>
IDyl first reads a few files (its standard library) and then starts the
Read-Eval-Print loop (REPL). If user filenames were supplied on the
command-line, these files are loaded just before IDyl starts the
REPL. The only option recognized by IDyl (<CODE>-emacs</CODE>) will be
explained below.  If IDyl is compiled with Gambit-C, you can also
specify the stack size, the heap size, and the size of the constant area
using the appropriate command-line option.

</P>
<P>
It should be noted that in contrast to most interpreters, IDyl does not
display a prompt that tells the user it is ready for
evaluation. Instead, the user enters an expression or a declaration and
then presses <CODE>return</CODE>. The interpreter then evaluates the
expression or declaration and displays the result prefixed by <CODE>//</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
It is also possible to feed the interpreter with an expression (or
multiple expressions) that span more than one line. To do this, the
first line of input should end with a backslash character
(<CODE>\</CODE>). This tells the interpreter to switch to multi-line mode. To
send the input to the interpreter, the user must enter <CODE>&#60;Ctrl-D&#62;</CODE>
on a new line. Here is a sample interaction:

</P>

<PRE>
% idyl <EM>&#60;cr&#62;</EM>
/*********************************/
/** IDyl v0.1    (05/25/95)     **/
/** Entering Dylan REP loop     **/
/** Type `quit ()' to exit      **/
/*********************************/
#"foo" <EM>&#60;cr&#62;</EM>
// value = #"foo"
1 + 2 <EM>&#60;cr&#62;</EM>
// value = 3
define class &#60;a&#62; (&#60;object&#62;) \<EM>&#60;cr&#62;</EM>
  slot a; <EM>&#60;cr&#62;</EM>
end ; <EM>&#60;cr&#62;</EM>
<EM>&#60;cr&#62;</EM>
define variable x = make (&#60;a&#62;) ; <EM>&#60;cr&#62;</EM>
<EM>&#60;^D&#62;</EM>
// value = {class &#60;A&#62;}
// value = #f 
quit () <EM>&#60;cr&#62;</EM>
% 
</PRE>

<P>
 

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>-emacs</CODE> command-line option can be used to switch to the
multi-line mode by default (as used by the Emacs mode for IDyl). In this
case, it is not necessary to enter the backslash character and a
<CODE>&#60;Ctrl-D&#62;</CODE> character must end the input to send to the interpreter.

<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="idyl_toc.html#SEC4">Differences with the DIRM</A></H1>

<P>
Here are the features that appear in the DIRM (Dylan Interim Reference
Manual) that are missing in IDyl:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Modules and libraries.

Modules and libraries are not yet supported by IDyl. Files
containing library and module declarations are parsed by IDyl but
these declarations are ignored by the interpreter. 

<LI>Return values.

Currently, there is no type-checking on return values; the number of
values returned is not checked either.

<LI>Collections.

Several methods and generic functions that relate to the collection
heterarchy have not yet been implemented. All the classes in the
heterarchy are defined, but few are actually instantiable. The
following classes are fully implemented: <CODE>&#60;array&#62;</CODE>,
<CODE>&#60;vector&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;simple-object-vector&#62;</CODE>,
<CODE>&#60;string&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;byte-string&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;list&#62;</CODE>, <CODE>&#60;pair&#62;</CODE>, and
<CODE>&#60;empty-list&#62;</CODE>. The other classes can be instantiated, but using them may
cause unpredictable behavior.

<LI>Numbers.

Only <CODE>&#60;integer&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>&#60;double-float&#62;</CODE> are instantiable
classes.  

<LI>Controlling dynamism.

IDyl can parse the adjectives that control the dynamism of Dylan's
functions and classes, but it doesn't make use of them. So
you can subclass a predefined sealed class, but the result is
unpredictable.

<LI>The <CODE>make</CODE> generic function.

<CODE>make</CODE> has not been specialized on <CODE>&#60;class&#62;</CODE> and
<CODE>&#60;generic-function&#62;</CODE> so it is not possible to dynamically create
new classes and generic functions. All classes and generic functions
must be defined using the <CODE>define class</CODE> and <CODE>define
generic</CODE> defining forms. 

<LI>The class precedence list computation algorithm.

With each class is associated a class precedence list (CPL). The CPL
of a class A is a list which contains all the superclasses of A in
some order. In IDyl, the CPL is computed by a monotonic algorithm
that differs from the CLOS algorithm described in the DIRM and that is
slighty more restrictive. I.e. some class heterarchies will be
rejected by IDyl, altough they are acceptable by the CLOS
algorithm.

</UL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="idyl_toc.html#SEC5">Extensions to the DIRM</A></H1>

<P>
IDyl provides a few functions and one class that are not described in
the DIRM. These are listed below.

</P>
<P>
<U>Function:</U> <B>quit</B> <I>=> never returns</I><P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
This function exits the interpreter. 

</P>
<P>
<U>Function:</U> <B>load</B> <I>byte-string => <CODE>#f</CODE></I><P>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
Loads the file specified by the argument. All the expressions and
declarations contained in the file are evaluated (in the same order as
they appear).

</P>

<P>
<U>Function:</U> <B>reset-environment</B> <I>=> <CODE>#f</CODE></I><P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
This function resets the global environment to its initial state (when
the interpreter was launched). 

</P>
<P>
<U>Function:</U> <B>printf</B> <I>byte-string #rest args => <CODE>#f</CODE></I><P>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>

</P>
<P>
This function is similar to the C <CODE>printf</CODE> function. The first
argument is a string template in which values can be inserted (see the
DIRM format string specification, p. 152, for the format
directives). The remaining arguments are those values that will be
inserted in the format string. 

</P>
<P>
<U>Instantiable class:</U> <B>&#60;window&#62;</B><P>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
It is possible to open windows under X-Windows. All windows are direct
instances of class <CODE>&#60;window&#62;</CODE>. Windows are opened at instance
creation time (i.e. in <CODE>make</CODE>). The recognized initialization
arguments are: <CODE>name:</CODE>, an instance of <CODE>&#60;byte-string&#62;</CODE>, is the
name of the window (mandatory); <CODE>&#60;width&#62;</CODE>, an instance of
<CODE>&#60;integer&#62;</CODE>, is the width of the window in pixels (default = 100);
<CODE>height:</CODE>, an instance of <CODE>&#60;integer&#62;</CODE>, is the height of the
window in pixels (default = 100).

</P>
<P>

<U>Generic function:</U> <B>close</B> <I>window => <CODE>#f</CODE></I><P>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
This functions closes the specified window and returns <CODE>#f</CODE>. It
signals a <CODE>&#60;simple-warning&#62;</CODE> condition if the window is already
closed.

</P>
<P>
<U>Generic function:</U> <B>draw-line</B> <I>window col x1 y1 x2 y2 => <CODE>#f</CODE></I><P>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
This functions draws a line between two points <CODE>(x1, y1)</CODE> and
<CODE>(x2, y2)</CODE> in the window <CODE>window</CODE>. The line drawn is of color
<CODE>col</CODE>. All the arguments must be instances of <CODE>&#60;integer&#62;</CODE>,
except <CODE>window</CODE>, which must be a instance of <CODE>&#60;window&#62;</CODE>.
<CODE>draw-line</CODE> signals a condition of type <CODE>&#60;simple-warning&#62;</CODE> if
the window is closed.
