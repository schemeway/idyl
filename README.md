IDyl v0.1
---------

This repository holds the code for a Dylan interpreter written in Scheme I wrote in the mid 90's at the University of Montreal. 

It was written for the Gambit-C compiler as well as the Bigloo compiler. The code has not been ported to later versions of those compilers, so the build process will fail miserably. If someone is interested in getting it run again, I'd be happy to integrate the necessary changes in the form of a pull request.
